I've always loved writing. From joining the school gernalism club many years ago, to starting [Blind Computing][bc],
which was initially completely article based, to the various blogs I created on [Google's Blogger platform][blogger]
in the years before that, it's always been a passion of mine to research and gather information from all across
the internet, and from life in general, and consolidate it into something that could be of use to someone else.

Recently, I rediscovered the lost, underappreciated internet relics that are RSS feeds, after I finally found a
good RSS feed reader for iOS called [Net News Wire][nnw]. This, at long last, caused me to give reading blogs a
propper shot, so I started reading blogs like [Faster Than Lime][ftl] and [Drew DeVault's Blog][ddb]. This lead
me to consider starting one of my own and, well, here we are.

## What You Can Expect

To be honest, right now, your guess is as good as mine. In general though, you can expect posts about:

* **Programming**, particularly of the system's programming type, using languages like [Rust][rust] (did I mention how
  much I love Rust?). And now that I have fancy syntax highlighting that Blogger could never give me, ...

    ```rust
    fn main() {
        println!("Hello, world!");
    }
    ```

      I'll be even more motivated to post about the code I write!
* **Free Software** and the current affairs and discussion surrounding the free software and open source movements.
* **Accessibility** for the blind / visually impaired, especially pertaining to technology.

For now, stay tuned: there'll be much more coming soon!
