summary: A Discord bot written in Rust using the [poise](https://github.com/serenity-rs/poise) framework (built on top of [serenity](https://github.com/serenity-rs/serenity)). This bot connects to your [Linkding](https://linkding.link) instance via its API, allowing Discord users to manage and share useful links with friends directly from Discord.
